# the-economist-audio-with-homemade-pdf
The project uses spider scripts to gather data from https://www.economist.com, then generates PDF files (including figure toggled versions) by LaTeX and finds their corresponding compressed audio URL.

Two PDF files and an audio URL file are included in each *The Economist* issue directory.

Pull requests and issues are welcomed.
